\section{Motivation and Idea}
\subsection{Motivation}
Although given that the final product should be related to saftey and address a saftey issue, which our following concept does, we also tried to make something out of the ordinary, which motivates us to learn the working of aurduino. 
\subsection{Concept}
Our final concept was to make a \textit{Remote Controlled car, equiped with sensors to detect threats and monitor/neutralize them with coil gun and cameras}. Though I went through many different concepts, like: Water gun with precize aim at fire, Car with automatic fire detection and neutralization, Dog in hostel detection and monitoring air quality levels, I decided to finalize on our former idea due to its complexity, budget constrains and other reasons.

\section{Workings and Troubleshooting}
\subsection{Finding Resources}
The idea of \textit{RC car with aurduino} and \textit{Coilgun controlled by aurduino} seprately has been worked on by many people many times. The diagrams and schematics of them, as well as code are available on web and can be found easily, though there isn't much I could find which combines both of these ideas. Hence although I had many of the resourses readily available for my help, learning how it is done, and making the changes was indeed very labour intensive. I have made my own schematics for both the Transciver and Reciver in the following section.
\subsection{Schematics}
First we shall look at the transmitter schematic as shown in FIG-1.

    \caption{Tramsitter Schematics}
    \label{fig:transmitter}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
Here we see the connection from the NRF module to the specific pins are done in such a way that allows the most compatiblity. For example in Aurduino-nano, pin D13, D12 and D11 act as SCK, MISO and MOSI respectively. Other connections are arbitary. The Joysitck X and Y pins are connected to analog pins. The power is transmitted across the components in the following way: 
$$\text{Battery (6V)} \implies \text{Aurduino Nano (5V)} \implies \text{NRF Module regulator (3.3V)} \implies \text{NRF Module}$$\\

Now we will look at the reciver schematics shown in FIG-2. Here although the NRF is connected in the same way to the aurduino, a few connections are done because of pin support, for example the ENA pin is connected to D9 because only few D pins support PWM which the L298 driver requires. The power is transmitted across the components in the follwoing way: 
\begin{align*}
	\text{Battery (11.1V)} \implies &\text{L298N Motor Driver(11.1)} \implies \text{4 x Motors}\\
					&\text{L298N Motor Driver(5V)} \implies \text{Aurduino Nano (5V))} \implies \text{NRF Module w/Regulator}
\end{align*}

\subsection{How I made it}
Since my main goal was to make a RC controlled car my first step was to make two different aurduino communicate. For the communication I decided to use \textbf{NRF24L01+PA+LNA SMA Antenna Wireless Transceiver communication module} as the price difference between the alternatives v/s this was not much where'as the range was significantly higher. This module operates at 3.3V, to regulate it we used \textbf{NRF24L01 regulator} which regulates the logic voltage. We used this regulator after trial and error which to regulate the voltage which will be discussed in later section.\\

For the motors, we use \textbf{4 x 300RPM PO Motors} since 300 RPM seemed in proper range for car with wheels of diameter $\approx 7\si{cm}$. These motors run on 12V. \\

For battery; in transmitter we used \textbf{4 x 1.5V alkaline battery} giving 6V which is given to aurduino $V_{in}$ pin. The aurduino has internal regulator which regulates it to 5V. The aurduino provides power to NRF/NRF regulator.\\ 

In reciver we used \textbf{3 x 3.7V LiOH battery} which are rechargable. The reason of using them will be discussed in the next section. This produce a voltage of $\approx 11$V which is given to \textbf{L298N Motor Driver} which runs the motors. The L298N has a internal regulator which regulates the voltage to 5V, this powers the aurduino.\\

A phone holder is added to back which can function as many things. \\

In reciver, the NRF is also power by aurduino through a regulator. Almost all of the connections are made using \textbf{Jumper wires of different types} and \textbf{Breadboard}. Some do use \textbf{High Gauge copper wires} to supply high current to motors.\\
\subsection{Issues I faced - and how I solved them}
\subsubsection{Battery unable to provide required power}
Initially I used \textbf{9V alkeline batteery}. A single 9V battery was unable to provide power to the motors so I used 4 of them in parralel. Although this made the car functional, it had many disadvantages. For example it was unrechargable, even 4 of them in series were sometimes not able to provide enough current, and the motors were rated for 12V, so 9V batteries weren't running the motors at maximum capacity.
\subsubsection{Search of proper chasis for car}
I needed a strong base for my car. A cardboard couldn't hold it's weight. A proper chasis was really hard to find and after some trial and error I finally setteled on a small black metal box which I found in a mechanics box. 
\subsubsection{Regulation of NRF module}
This was a really big issue when we first started testing, since to make anything out of this project I first had to communicate between two aurduinos. The NRF module operates at 3.3V, and the aurduino logic is 5V. I had to use some kind of way to regulate it. First I used resistor dividers, but it turned out that they cause high level of signal disturbance. Then I used voltage regulators, these kind of worked but there was always some kind of issue which made the modules unable to communicate. Also since the NRF module needs large supply of current peaks my initial tests were without a parallel capacitors, so no matter how I regulated the voltage the module was unable to communicate. This was finally resolved by using a dedicated NRF voltage regulator which was compact, cheap and does everything we needed.
\subsubsection{Fused and non working components}
Many of the components got fused while we were working on them, this include but not limited to: Aurduino nano, A NRF module, etc. To prevent this from further happening on other components I found the following helpful: Not soldering components directely to the other components, using voltage limiters, reading the datasheet (obvious but we initially ignored this) and by not shorting the components (obvious but thats how my nano got fused).
\subsubsection{Weight, Speed Structure and Battery life}
For weight and Speed and battery life all these three issue were solved by LiOH batteries. To fix the motor ot the chasis I used feviquick which worked really good and was able to carry good about of weight on the car. Other components were fixed by hot glue and teh final structre was made after many trial and errors
