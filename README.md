If someone wants to do the same then do it in the follwoing order:

### PS
Everything in this report is written by me other than the code for aurduinos. I have used grammerly as an assistant for grammer correction after completing the report entirely. Much of the code is written by AI though I woudn't suggest anyone to do the same.
